## Description
 
 This is my first [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application.[SHRTCODE](https://shrtco.de/docs) API is used here to shorten the queried URL's.It took me about a day to complete this project from scratch means from all of its design to working principles.I have used [Formik](https://formik.org/) to handle the form section cause it's easy to learn and use.I have also used [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling and [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/) motion library to animate some of its section.Building this project was fun and also was trickier in some sections.I learned so many things about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the most importantly is that it provides features like SSR and CSR both.That's totally insane right? :scream:
